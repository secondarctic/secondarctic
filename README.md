# Hi! 

### My name is Matt!


I'm a software engineer, photographer, artist, traveler, critter, gamer, and avid D&D enthusiast. ***So, basically I'm a giant nerd.***

I love creating, and building things with code. I can just as easily get lost for hours fine-tuning CSS or iterating through array methods, as I can retouching a photograph, playing a video game, watching an episode of *Critical Role*, or reading a book. 

**Software engineering is my passion**, and it is at the forefront of my endeavors! My background is tethered to more *'aesthetic'* disciplines. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism (specializing in video production) from the University of Georgia, and a Master of Fine Arts in Photography from the Savannah College of Art & Design.

My greatest artistic inspirations can be found in the works of Ansel Adams, Dieter Appelt, Joseph Beuys, the philosophies of Roland Gérard Barthes, the complete imaginative storytelling prowess of the *Critical Role* cast, the writing of Neil Gaiman, animation from Japan, and anything involving dungeons, dragons, *or* both dungeons ***and*** dragons.

My personal philosophy has long read:

***Light. Changes. Everything.*** 

### *Some of my favorite words from the minds of others:* 

**"What's past is prologue."**  — *William Shakespeare*
  

**"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."** — *Isaac Netwon (by way of those before him)*

**"I am the master of my fate, <br> I am the captain of my soul."**  — *William Ernest Henley*. 


## My hopes for the future

I have an interest in contributing to open source projects, and I want build things that help make people's lives better and that make the world better a place.
